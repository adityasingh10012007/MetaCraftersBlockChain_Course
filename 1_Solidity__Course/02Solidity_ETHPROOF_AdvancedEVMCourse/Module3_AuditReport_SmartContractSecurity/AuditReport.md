# Smart Contract Security Audit Report



## Solidity Version Recommendation
**Problem :**  The use of pragma version^0.4.23 is not recommended for deployment.

# Old Code 

" pragma solidity ^0.4.23; "


**Fixes :** The contract has been updated to use Solidity version 0.8.18, which is the latest stable version.

# New Code 

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;






## Constructor Implementation
**Problem :**   The function `StorageVictim()` is not allowed to have the same name as the contract.

# Old code 

function StorageVictim() public {
   owner = msg.sender;
}


**Fixes :**  It has been refactored using the constructor syntax.

# New Code 

constructor() {
    owner = msg.sender;
}






## Data Location Specification
**Problem :**   Data location must be "storage", "memory" or "calldata" for variable . The data location of the structs is not explicitly specified.

# Old code 

Storage str;
storages[msg.sender] = str;


**Fixes :** It has been updated to specify "memory" for the relevant variables.

# New Code 

Storage memory str = Storage({user: msg.sender, amount: amount_});
storages[msg.sender] = str;







## Uninitialized Local Variable
**Problem :**   The variable `str` is uninitialized, which may lead to zero values when accessing the struct's contents.

# Old code 

Storage memory str;


**Fixes :**  It has been initialized to avoid this issue.

# New Code 
 Storage memory str = Storage({user: msg.sender, amount: _amount});








## Immutable State Variable
**Problem :**   The `owner` variable is set at the contract's creation and is expected to remain unchanged. 

# Old code 

address owner;


**Fixes :**  It has been marked as immutable for enhanced security.

# New Code 

 address immutable owner;








## Naming Convention
**Problem :**   The parameter `_amount` does not follow the Solidity naming convention.

# Old code 

function store(uint _amount) public {
   Storage memory str = Storage({user: msg.sender, amount: _amount});
   storages[msg.sender] = str;
}


**Fixes :**  It has been renamed to `amount_`.

# New Code 

function store(uint amount_) public {
   Storage memory str = Storage({user: msg.sender, amount: amount_});
   storages[msg.sender] = str;
}
